# Elliott 920 Controller
This project creates a Rapsberry Pi system to interact with an Elliott 
920 Control Panel - using GPIO and I2C I/O, and a version of Andrew Herbert's 
Elliott 900 series emulator.

Phase 1 - creates a GTK+ GUI and interacts with the 920 Controller.

Phase 2 - extends the GUI and incorporates the 900 emulator, so that 
Elliot code can once again be run via the control panel.
